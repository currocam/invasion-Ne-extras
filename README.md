# invasion-Ne-extras

This repository is part of an ongoing study of inferring very recent Ne for invasion scenarios(https://github.com/svardallab/invasion-Ne). Although results are still preliminary, you may try some of the developed methods with your own (real or simulated) data. The necessary code and tools to perform your own analysis are provided in this repository.

We recommend you go through the notebooks in order:
- `notebooks/0-processing-data.ipynb`
- `notebooks/01-constant-Ne.ipynb`
- `notebooks/02-exponential-constant-Ne.ipynb`
